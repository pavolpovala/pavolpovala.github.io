We show how the determinants of return distributions change across different investment horizons, and discuss differences in prospective returns on long- and short-duration bonds. Using a realistic calibration, we show that it is unlikely that long-duration bond returns will match the experience in the last few decades. Assuming that macro trends are flat on average, the return distributions of short- and long-duration bonds are comparable, despite long-duration bonds earning a term premium. For long-duration bonds to generate returns closer to historical experience, long-term growth prospects would likely need to deteriorate from today's levels.","tags":["yield curve modelling","macro trends","simulation mode","empirical asset pricing","asset allocation"],"title":"Simulating Long-horizon Returns on Government Bonds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala","Ľudovít Ódor"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475798400,"objectID":"f417016902b17fa5db56c815101c62cc","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2016_preprint_slovak_risk_premiums/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_preprint_slovak_risk_premiums/","section":"publication","summary":"We study risk premiums in Slovak government bonds.

While the level of the term structure of spreads is mostly related to sovereigncredit risk, non-default components are related to the second principal component of spreads.

Short-rate expectations become more volatile than premia before recessions and during asset market distress. Correlation between shocks to premia and shocks to short-rate expectations is close to zero on average and varies with the monetary policy stance. While Treasuries are nearly unexposed to variance shocks, investors pay a premium for hedging variance risk with derivatives.

We decompose Treasury yields into inflation expectations and maturity-specific interest-rate cycles, which we define as variation in yields orthogonal to expected inflation. The short-maturity cycle captures the real short-rate dynamics. Jointly with expected inflation, it comprises the expectations hypothesis (EH) term in the yield curve. Controlling for the EH term, we extract a measure of risk-premium variation from yields. The risk-premium factor forecasts excess bond returns in and out of sample and subsumes the common bond return predictor obtained as a linear combination of forward rates.","tags":["Interest Rates","Term Structure","Asset Pricing","Trading volume","Bond Interest Rates"],"title":"Expected Returns in Treasury Bonds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d84441da5cc09548da15ccd71deb948e","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2015_confdis_feldhuetteretal/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_confdis_feldhuetteretal/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"Risk Premia and Volatilities in a Nonlinear Term Structure Model by Peter Feldhuetter, Christian Heyerdahl-Larsen, and Philipp Illeditsch\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Cieslak","Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"61845ea08f5552a72f833f5eb5c3c164","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2014_preprint_nominal_term_spread/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_preprint_nominal_term_spread/","section":"publication","summary":"Robust empirical evidence suggests that a steep slope of the nominal yield curve predicts an increase in the future real activity. We show that the negative of the slope closely traces the variation in the ex-ante real rate. We then argue that the predictive content of the slope for real activity empirically encapsulates the intertemporal tradeoff that arises in a broad class of equilibrium models. As a key implication, the estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) from the aggregate Euler equation are severely downwardly biased, implying a negative aggregate EIS. A model with heterogeneous agents and limited market participation can reconcile the positive EIS found in micro data with the negative relationship between the ex-ante real rate and aggregate consumption and output.","tags":["Real interest rate","term structure of interest rates","Euler equation","elasticity of intertemporal substitution"],"title":"Nominal Term Spread, Real Rate and Consumption Growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"0738eb8a2819fb7fe9dab76035b68609","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2014_confdis_pericoli/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_confdis_pericoli/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"Interest rate spillovers during quantitative easing by Marcello Pericoli\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"fc8a7d1da085548945f1a251491f0011","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2012_confdis_ozdagliandyu/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_confdis_ozdagliandyu/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"Monetary Policy Shocks and Stock Returns -
