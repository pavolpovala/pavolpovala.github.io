We focus on the country-specific part of yieldswhich we associate with the spread to overnight-indexed swaps. In the period 2009-2015, we decomposethe term structure of spreads to credit risk premium, liquidity premium, safety/convenience demand, andsegmentation effects.   While the level of the term structure of spreads is mostly related to sovereigncredit risk, non-default components are related to the second principal component of spreads.  We alsoidentify a siezable effect of public sector purchase programme conducted by the European Central Bankwith a magnitude in excess of 60 basis points for the ten-year bond.  To study determinants of spreadsin a longer sample 2000-2015, we construct credit spreads from international euro-denominated bonds.We find that debt-to-GDP ratio together with global financial variables explain a substantial fraction ofspread variation.","tags":["Risk premiums","yield curve models","sovereign credit risk","liquidity"],"title":"An example preprint / working paper","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Cieslak","Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"4f361bdabf94abd69a863bc950b62bf0","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2016_journal_cieslak_povala_jof/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_journal_cieslak_povala_jof/","section":"publication","summary":"Using a novel no-arbitrage model and extensive second-moment data, we decompose conditional volatility of U.S. Treasury yields into volatilities of short-rate expectations and term premia. Short-rate expectations become more volatile than premia before recessions and during asset market distress. Correlation between shocks to premia and shocks to short-rate expectations is close to zero on average and varies with the monetary policy stance. While Treasuries are nearly unexposed to variance shocks, investors pay a premium for hedging variance risk with derivatives. We illustrate the dynamics of the yield volatility components during and after the financial crisis.","tags":["yield curve modelling","applied econometrics","volatility","empirical asset pricing","high frequency data"],"title":"Information in the Term Structure of Yield Curve Volatility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Cieslak","Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"e35001696255ae235360b7131e9a0fbb","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2015_journal_cieslak_povala_rfs/","publishdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_journal_cieslak_povala_rfs/","section":"publication","summary":"We study risk premium in U.S. Treasury bonds. We decompose Treasury yields into inflation expectations and maturity-specific interest-rate cycles, which we define as variation in yields orthogonal to expected inflation. The short-maturity cycle captures the real short-rate dynamics. Jointly with expected inflation, it comprises the expectations hypothesis (EH) term in the yield curve. Controlling for the EH term, we extract a measure of risk-premium variation from yields. The risk-premium factor forecasts excess bond returns in and out of sample and subsumes the common bond return predictor obtained as a linear combination of forward rates.","tags":["Interest Rates","Term Structure","Asset Pricing","Trading volume","Bond Interest Rates"],"title":"Expected Returns in Treasury Bonds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d84441da5cc09548da15ccd71deb948e","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2015_confdis_feldhuetteretal/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_confdis_feldhuetteretal/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"Risk Premia and Volatilities in a Nonlinear Term Structure Model by Peter Feldhuetter, Christian Heyerdahl-Larsen, and Philipp Illeditsch\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Cieslak","Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"61845ea08f5552a72f833f5eb5c3c164","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2014_preprint_nominal_term_spread/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_preprint_nominal_term_spread/","section":"publication","summary":"Robust empirical evidence suggests that a steep slope of the nominal yield curve predicts an increase in the future real activity. We show that the negative of the slope closely traces the variation in the ex-ante real rate. We then argue that the predictive content of the slope for real activity empirically encapsulates the intertemporal tradeoff that arises in a broad class of equilibrium models. As a key implication, the estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) from the aggregate Euler equation are severely downwardly biased, implying a negative aggregate EIS. A model with heterogeneous agents and limited market participation can reconcile the positive EIS found in micro data with the negative relationship between the ex-ante real rate and aggregate consumption and output.","tags":["Real interest rate","term structure of interest rates","Euler equation","elasticity of intertemporal substitution"],"title":"Nominal Term Spread, Real Rate and Consumption Growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"0738eb8a2819fb7fe9dab76035b68609","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2014_confdis_pericoli/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_confdis_pericoli/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"Interest rate spillovers during quantitative easing by Marcello Pericoli\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"fc8a7d1da085548945f1a251491f0011","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2012_confdis_ozdagliandyu/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_confdis_ozdagliandyu/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"Monetary Policy Shocks and Stock Returns - Identification Through Impossible Trinity by  Ozdagli and  Yu\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"4b067a44b7431cf869e34bedb4a2bdb7","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2012_confdis_kitsulandwright/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_confdis_kitsulandwright/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"The Economics of Options-Implied Inflation Probability Density Functions by Kitsul and Wright\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"70d678a5b09e9a80727ac782002dbb0f","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2011_confdis_baueretal/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011_confdis_baueretal/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"A Multi-Country Term Structure Model with Unspanned Risks by Bauer and Diez de los Rios\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"d943e5998903a2c23a0ec1aaad3711ad","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2011_confdis_hanandzhou/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011_confdis_hanandzhou/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"Term Structure of Credit Default Swap Spreads and Cross-Section of Stock Returns by  Han and  Zhou\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"0558119712bc67e291df625ab6b56c28","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2011_confdis_muhlekarbeetal/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011_confdis_muhlekarbeetal/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"Transaction Costs, Trading Volume, and the Liquidity Premium by Muhle-Karbe, Gerhold, Guasoni and Schachermeyer\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1291161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1291161600,"objectID":"fc2d15501f1995adfe7cb86cf37a4bbd","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2010_confdis_eisletal_ewfs/","publishdate":"2010-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010_confdis_eisletal_ewfs/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"Exploring the Performance of Government Debt Issuance by  Eisl,  Elendner and  Pichler.\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pavol Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1291161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1291161600,"objectID":"972f07096a18fceb9b943de3f56cb5b3","permalink":"https://pavol.povala.com/publication/2016_confdis_guimaraes/","publishdate":"2010-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_confdis_guimaraes/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discussion of \"Monetary Policy Disagreement by Rodrigo Guimaraes and Paul Whelan\"","type":"publication"}]
